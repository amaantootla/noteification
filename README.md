markdown support (parser)
sleek UI
simple CRUD
AI integration for smart folders? 

views.py
# TODO update status codes to be proper
# TODO use POST/PUT in the right context
# TODO checking existance then ownership is leaking data?

main.js
# TODO each note entry should have a delete button and a config button
config should just honestly be choosing what tags to be put into (just a HTML selection)

tests.py
all endpoints on the serverside (with security in mind)
