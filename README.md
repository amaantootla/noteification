UI

index.html - shows "All Notes" (default), list by newest notes first & "Folders" (folder.html)

folder.html - allows deleting the folder, changing it's name, and lists all notes in there (note.html)

note.html - shows a Zen text editor with a back button to get to folder view of all notes, allow moving to another folder

API-ish
